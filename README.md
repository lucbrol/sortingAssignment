This project was set to understand algorithms.  I used merge, selection and Insertion on different data sizes to see which ones worked best on larger number sets 
compared to smaller data sizes.  This project was accompanied with line graphs and tables to compare time taken as data siz grew.  I used code to create data in random 
order which was saved in csv files.
